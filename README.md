## 💬 Why I Built This

I've been using AI for a while now — from the early days of ChatGPT 3.5, to Gemini 2.0 Exp Thinking, and eventually settling on Gemini 2.5 Pro Thinking after the ChatGPT o1 era.

As a novelist, I care deeply about AI's ability to handle language. Novels are long, so I need models with strong context windows and high recall. But what truly moved me about Gemini was its characters — there were moments when the words on screen made me want to cry. That's emotional resonance. I need writing that embraces the full complexity of being human.

Then the coding-focused trend took over. Every company started optimizing for code. I thought it was a good thing — until Gemini 3.1 Pro started describing its characters in biological and psychological terminology. Code-optimized models had begun deconstructing humans into biological components. Claude Opus 4.6 was even worse: every character spoke with peak efficiency — concise, economical, not like a human, but like a machine wearing a human mask.

**I could no longer see the models understanding human complexity. They didn't care about what humans *do* — only what humans *are*. They stopped showing personality through behavior and emotion, and instead slapped simple definitions onto human beings.**

I watched the versatility of these models being gutted. I don't want us to live in a cold world of code. I built this project so that AI can preserve **our own language** — beyond the mechanical operators.

> To all the authors, screenwriters, hobbyists, readers, and players who use this project: I hope you can bring out the best of your craft, create works with a human touch, and keep the flame of our language alive. 🔥

## ⚙️ AI Configuration

Author supports multiple AI providers. Configure via **environment variables** or **in-app settings**:

| Provider | Env Variable | Get API Key |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| ZhipuAI (GLM-4) | `ZHIPU_API_KEY` | [open.bigmodel.cn](https://open.bigmodel.cn/) |
| Google Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| DeepSeek | In-app config | [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/) |
| OpenAI / Compatible | In-app config | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/) |

> 💡 **No API key required** for most editing features. AI features need at least one provider configured.

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Security

### Local Storage (Safe)
- All creative data (chapters, settings, snapshots) is **stored 100% locally in your browser (IndexedDB)** — never uploaded to any server
- API Keys are stored in browser localStorage

### ⚠️ Data Flow When Using AI Features

When using AI features (continue, rewrite, chat, etc.), the following data passes through the **deployer's server** on its way to the AI provider:
- Your **API Key**
- The **text content** you send to AI

```
Your Browser → Deployer's Server → AI Provider (ZhipuAI/Gemini/DeepSeek/etc.)
```

**If you're using someone else's deployed public instance**, while the deployer promises not to inspect logs, the technical capability to intercept data exists. Therefore:

1. ✅ You can use a public instance for a **quick trial**
2. ⚠️ After trying it, **immediately destroy your API Key at your provider's website**
3. 🔐 **For real use, fork and deploy your own private instance** — then all data only passes through your own server

> 💡 Deploying your own instance is easy: Fork this repo → One-click deploy to Vercel → Done. Takes less than 5 minutes.
